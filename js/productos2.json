Some say they're the best way to pack a suitcase, because you can pack much more and use the bags to hold dirty clothes on the way back.  You can even wash clothes in the bag if you add water and soap and then shake and massage it. Other reviewers warn that compression bags wrinkle thin fabrics, and they can make it easy to pack too much and end up with an overweight bag."

Further, international travel spending fell 76%, and corporate travel spending fell 70%."
